# SonNet.AI - Wi-Fi Mesh and Sonar Simulation Project

## Overview
This project simulates a low-power Wi-Fi mesh network powered by sonar waves, utilizing terrain data, 3D buildings, and real-time AI agents. The goal is to demonstrate how Wi-Fi can be provided to underserved areas using a mesh system in a remote environment, such as Lesotho High School in Africa.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following libraries installed to run the project:
- Python 3.x
- Blender (for 3D terrain and building visualization)
- Various Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Folder Structure
This project is organized into the following folders:
- **data/**: Contains raw data files (e.g., GeoJSON, terrain models).
- **src/**: Contains main Python code files for simulation and integration.
- **assets/**: Contains 3D models and assets for Blender integration.
- **web_ui/**: Contains the web interface for visualizing Wi-Fi mesh and simulation data.
- **logs/**: Stores log files for tracking simulation performance and behavior.



## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
