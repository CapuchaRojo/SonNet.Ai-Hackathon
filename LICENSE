### **Using Notepad for Project Management:**

1. **Set up your `requirements.txt`** with the libraries youâ€™ll use in your project (as seen above).
2. **Organize your code** in `src/` to keep it clean and manageable.
3. **Store your terrain, 3D building, and simulation assets** in the respective folders.
4. **Log everything** in the `logs/` folder to track the performance of your simulation and network.

This structure will ensure your project remains organized as it grows, and youâ€™ll always know where everything is located. You can easily add more files, libraries, and assets as needed.

Let me know if you need help with any of the steps or adjustments! Happy coding, and good luck with your project! ðŸ˜Ž
